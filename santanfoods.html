            There were multiple needs and multiple stakeholders involved in the

          <p class="ideation-sub">
            The UI/UX ideation for SantanFoods began with understanding the core
            needs of modern food delivery users—speed, simplicity, and
            satisfaction. I started by mapping out user flows for common
            scenarios like browsing meals, placing orders, and tracking
            deliveries. Through competitor analysis and user interviews, I
            identified key pain points in existing apps, such as cluttered
            interfaces and confusing navigation. These insights shaped the
            design direction: a clean, intuitive layout with bold visuals,
            minimal steps, and clear call-to-actions. Wireframes and
            low-fidelity prototypes were created to test various interaction
            models, focusing on making the experience as frictionless as
            possible. The goal was to craft a user journey that feels natural,
            efficient, and even enjoyable

          <p class="ideation-sub">
            During the Information Architecture (IA) Sprint for SantanFoods, I
            focused on structuring content and features in a way that aligned
            with users’ mental models and expectations. I began by identifying
            primary user goals—finding meals quickly, customizing orders, and
            tracking deliveries. With these goals in mind, I conducted a
            card-sorting exercise to group related features and menu items
            logically. This helped define the app’s core navigation, including
            sections like Home, Browse, Orders, Favorites, and Profile.
            Low-fidelity sitemaps and user flow diagrams were created to ensure
            that every screen and interaction felt intuitive and streamlined.
            The sprint played a crucial role in laying the foundation for a
            seamless user experience, making it easy for users to go from food
            discovery to checkout without cognitive overload.

            With the information architecture solidified, I moved into the
            low-fidelity prototyping phase to bring the user flows of
            SantanFoods to life. Using tools like Figma, I sketched out
            wireframes that focused purely on layout, functionality, and
            navigation—without getting distracted by visuals or color. These
            grayscale screens illustrated key interactions such as onboarding,
            browsing meals, viewing item details, customizing orders, and
            checking out. The goal at this stage was to validate the core
            experience and ensure users could accomplish their tasks with ease.
            Through quick iterations and informal usability tests, I gathered
            feedback early, allowing me to refine navigation, improve screen
            hierarchy, and remove friction points before moving on to
            high-fidelity design.

            After validating the core user flows with low-fidelity wireframes, I
            transitioned into building the high-fidelity prototype of
            SantanFoods. This phase focused on bringing the app to life with a
            polished visual design, incorporating brand colors, typography,
            imagery, and micro-interactions. Every element—from appetizing food
            photos to smooth transitions—was carefully crafted to enhance user
            engagement and create an inviting experience. I designed with
            accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring the interface was
            visually appealing and functional across various screen sizes. The
            prototype captured the full end-to-end experience, including
            onboarding, meal discovery, customization, checkout, and order
            tracking. It was also used for stakeholder reviews and user testing,
            providing valuable insights that led to final refinements before
            handoff to development.

            the prototype, I made many changes in the design. The feedback from
