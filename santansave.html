            In an eight-week school project, I collaborated with eight

            for sharing personal stories about seeking and receiving help in
            city of Siegen. Our team conducted research, generated new ideas,
            and developed wireframes and prototypes to refine the existing

            images, and colors to ensure inclusivity for all users. Through our

            The low-fidelity prototype served as the initial visual and

            It focused on layout, functionality, and user interactions without
            detailed visuals or branding. Using grayscale wireframes, I mapped
            out the core screens and interactions, including the onboarding
            process, main dashboard, feature-specific pages, and navigation
            patterns. This stage allowed for rapid ideation and feedback,
            enabling early user testing and quick iterations. The goal was to
            validate the overall structure, usability, and logic of the
            experience before moving into high-fidelity design. It also served
            as a collaborative tool during discussions with stakeholders and
            developers to align on functionality and user needs.

          After the visual design was completed. I conducted a usability test
          with 2 participants, to check if the application is usable and
          accessible to my targeted audience which are undergraduate students.
          This session was conducted using the maze website where the Figma
          prototype was uploaded for user to access and navigate through. The
          test was conducted on Google Meet video call where the participants
          were given the following tasks while I observed how they navigated
          through the application.
